Assume everything can change. This draft specification will change before being
accepted as standard, so implementations made to this draft specification will
likely not conform to the future standard.

== Atomic Memory Operations Extension (Zaamo) 

The Zaamo extension comprises the atomic memory operation (AMO) subset of the A
extension, consisting of the following instructions:

* `AMOSWAP.W/D`
* `AMOADD.W/D`
* `AMOAND.W/D`
* `AMOOR.W/D`
* `AMOXOR.W/D`
* `AMOMAX[U].W/D`
* `AMOMIN[U].W/D`

[NOTE]
====
The Zaamo extension enables microcontroller class implementations to implement
atomic primitives using the AMO subset of the A extension. Typically such
implementations do not have caches and thus may not be able to naturally support
the `LR`/`SC` instructions provided by the A extension.
====

== Load-Reserved/Store-conditional Extension (Zalrsc) 

The Zalrsc extension comprises the Load-Reserved/Store-Conditional instruction
subset of the A extension, consisting of the `LR.W/D` and `SC.W/D` instructions.

[NOTE]
====
The fetch-and-op style atomic primitives provided by the A extension support
better scaling for highly parallel systems. Simpler implementations that do not
have such scaling requirements may implement Zalrsc subset of the A extension to
support atomic primitives.
