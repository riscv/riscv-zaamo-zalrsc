====
Change is extremely unlikely. A high threshold will be used, and a change will
only occur because of some truly critical issue being identified during the
public review cycle. Any other desired or needed changes can be the subject of a
follow-on new extension.

== Atomic Memory Operations Extension (Zaamo) 

The Zaamo extension comprises the atomic memory operation (AMO) subset of the A
extension cite:[unpriv].

For RV32, the Zaamo extension includes the following instructions:

* `AMOSWAP.W`
* `AMOADD.W`
* `AMOAND.W`
* `AMOOR.W`
* `AMOXOR.W`
* `AMOMAX[U].W`
* `AMOMIN[U].W`

For RV64, the Zaamo extension includes the following instructions:

* `AMOSWAP.W/D`
* `AMOADD.W/D`
* `AMOAND.W/D`
* `AMOOR.W/D`
* `AMOXOR.W/D`
* `AMOMAX[U].W/D`
* `AMOMIN[U].W/D`

The Zacas extension cite:[zacas] depends on the Zaamo extension.

[NOTE]
====
The Zaamo extension enables microcontroller class implementations to utilize
atomic primitives from the AMO subset of the A extension. Typically such
implementations do not have caches and thus may not be able to naturally support
the `LR`/`SC` instructions provided by the A extension.
====

== Load-Reserved/Store-conditional Extension (Zalrsc) 

The Zalrsc extension comprises the Load-Reserved/Store-Conditional instruction
subset of the A extension.

For RV32, the Zalrsc extension includes the `LR.W` and `SC.W` instructions.

For RV64, the Zalrsc extension includes the `LR.W/D` and `SC.W/D` instructions.

[NOTE]
====
The fetch-and-op style atomic primitives provided by the A extension support
better scaling for highly parallel systems. Simpler implementations that do not
have such scaling requirements may implement the Zalrsc subset of the A extension
to support atomic primitives.
